# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a programming challenge advent
calendar. It offers Christmas-themed challenges from Dec 1 - Dec 25.

I'm committing to completing the challenges for the 2024 season. Not necessarily
each day, since December happens to be a very busy time (I wonder why?), but I
want to finish an entire Advent of Code challenge, and this seems to be the year
for it.

# A note on quality
My aim with completing this challenge is not to produce the highest-quality code
as I usually do. It is to practice coding *fast*. In other words, I'm focused on
quantity over quality here.
